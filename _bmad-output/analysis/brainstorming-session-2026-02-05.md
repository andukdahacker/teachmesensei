# TeachMeSensei — Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Ducdo
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Ideas Generated:** 100
**Techniques Used:** Assumption Reversal, Cross-Pollination (6 industries), SCAMPER (4 pillars)

---

## Session Overview

**Original Concept:** TutorMe — a tutoring platform with courses, 1-on-1 sessions, and smart matchmaking.
**Evolved Concept:** TeachMeSensei — a mentorship community connecting wanderer-learners with working professionals who want to give back. Not a tutoring marketplace, but a mentorship community with payments.

**Goals:** Deepen and challenge existing concepts, uncover blind spots, generate novel features and strategies that differentiate the platform.

### Core Identity Shift

Through Assumption Reversal, the concept was fundamentally reimagined:

| Original Assumption | New Direction |
|---|---|
| Learners want guided paths | Learners are wanderers — design for curiosity, not curricula |
| Tutors are teachers | Mentors are working professionals who guide, not lecture |
| Users pay per session/course | Wanderers pay for access to a network |
| Learners rate tutors | Behavioral signals replace star ratings |
| Money keeps practitioners | Identity, community, and growth keep them |
| Platform takes commission | Platform charges transparent infrastructure fees |
| Learners know what to learn | Learners arrive with intentions, not subjects |
| Build both sides at once | Launch as a mentor tool, marketplace comes later |

---

## Thematic Organization (100 Ideas)

### Theme 1: The Wanderer's Journey — How Learners Experience the Platform

**[Learning #1]**: The Anti-Curriculum
_Concept_: TikTok-style curiosity feed where learners swipe through bite-sized concept explanations, mentor clips, and micro-lessons. Follow your interest, not a syllabus.
_Novelty_: Every competitor builds more structure. TeachMeSensei wins by embracing productive chaos.

**[Learning #2]**: Knowledge Constellations
_Concept_: Visual constellation map of everything a learner has touched — topics, mentors, sessions. Patterns emerge organically. "You've been circling around machine learning without realizing it."
_Novelty_: Turns wandering into self-discovery rather than failure to complete a course.

**[Learner #28]**: The Intention Prompt, Not the Search Bar
_Concept_: No search bar on landing. Instead: "What are you trying to accomplish?" AI parses intent and routes to a type of help — quick answer, guided exploration, career navigation, project rescue.
_Novelty_: Meets learners where they are emotionally, not just academically.

**[Learner #29]**: The Mood-Based Entry
_Concept_: Three buttons: "I'm stuck" / "I'm curious" / "I'm preparing." Each routes to a different experience adapted to emotional state.
_Novelty_: Same learner needs different things on different days. Platform adapts.

**[Learner #30]**: The Curiosity Feed
_Concept_: Scrollable feed of short mentor clips. 45-second videos, real-time sketches, hot takes. Tap "Talk to this Sensei" → live micro-session in 60 seconds.
_Novelty_: You don't search for what you need — you stumble into what you didn't know you needed. Content IS matchmaking.

**[Learner #31]**: Sensei Trails
_Concept_: See a mentor's "trail" — other topics, other learners' journeys that started similarly. Breadcrumbs left by other wanderers.
_Novelty_: Social proof navigation. Following footprints of people who were lost the same way.

**[Learner #35]**: The Growth Journal
_Concept_: Auto-populating journal of every interaction, question, and AI-flagged "aha moment." Over months becomes a shareable artifact of personal transformation.
_Novelty_: Turns passive consumption into visible personal transformation.

**[Cross-Pol #57]**: Fork a Learning Path
_Concept_: Completed learner journeys become public "repos." New learners fork and customize. Knowledge of how to learn becomes open source.
_Novelty_: Community generates roadmaps. Value compounds as paths get forked and validated.

**[Cross-Pol #59]**: Discover Weekly for Mentorship
_Concept_: Weekly, platform surfaces one Sensei the learner hasn't met but would probably love. Based on behavioral patterns, not subject matching.
_Novelty_: True discovery beyond search and filter. Platform knows your learning taste better than you.

**[SCAMPER #69]**: The Silent SOS
_Concept_: Platform detects when a learner is stuck without them asking — same page for 20 minutes, rewatched clips, abandoned Flash Help drafts. Gently surfaces: "Looks like you might be stuck."
_Novelty_: Catches the silent struggles. Many learners never ask for help due to pride or imposter syndrome.

**[SCAMPER #70]**: The Lurk Tier
_Concept_: Pure lurking before signup. Browse the curiosity feed, watch clips, read quest logs. No account needed. Conversion happens when something is so compelling they have to interact.
_Novelty_: Open front door reduces the biggest conversion barrier.

**[Emotional #99]**: The Imposter Syndrome Companion
_Concept_: AI detects imposter syndrome signals and responds with normalization first — connecting learners to Senseis who felt the same way — before technical help.
_Novelty_: Addresses the biggest barrier to learning that no competitor will touch.

### Theme 2: The Relationship Engine — How Connections Form and Deepen

**[Tutor Role #6]**: "2 Years Ahead" Matching
_Concept_: Match on proximity of experience, not raw expertise. A junior dev who landed their first job 2 years ago is a better Sherpa for a bootcamp student than a 20-year veteran.
_Novelty_: Inverts the assumption that more expertise = better tutor. Optimizes for empathy and relevance.

**[Tutor Role #3]**: Tutor Style Profiles
_Concept_: Mentors self-identify their facilitation style — DJ, Sherpa, Provocateur, or blends. Learners filter by how they want to be guided, not just subject.
_Novelty_: No platform matches on teaching style. Genuine differentiator.

**[Learner #32]**: Discover Mode vs. Follow Mode
_Concept_: Two modes. Discover: curiosity feed, Flash Help, wandering. Follow: activated by tapping "Follow this Sensei" for deeper engagement. Frictionless transition.
_Novelty_: Discover is the dating app. Follow is the relationship.

**[Learner #33]**: The Soft Commitment Gradient
_Concept_: Follow → interact → book → recur. Gentle nudges: "You've had 4 great sessions with Marcus. Want a regular time?" No 10-packs or upsells.
_Novelty_: Commitment builds through earned trust, not sales pressure.

**[Cross-Pol #45]**: The Sensei Reaches Out
_Concept_: Mentors browse learner questions and proactively offer help. Instead of learners shopping, mentors find learners they're drawn to help.
_Novelty_: Flips marketplace dynamic. Creates authentic connections — the mentor chose YOU.

**[Cross-Pol #46]**: The Mentor Draft
_Concept_: Learners post their situation (not a question). Multiple mentors express interest. Talent comes to you.
_Novelty_: Learners feel wanted. Mentors compete on empathy, not credentials.

**[Cross-Pol #47]**: The Warm Intro
_Concept_: Mentors personally introduce learners to other mentors. Warm handoffs, not cold search results.
_Novelty_: Every connection comes through trust. Destroys cold marketplace feel.

**[Cross-Pol #55]**: The Intentional Match Limit
_Concept_: Only 3 Follows at a time in Follow Mode. Forces intentional commitment. Discover Mode stays unlimited.
_Novelty_: Artificial scarcity on relationships creates value.

**[Cross-Pol #61]**: The Producer Credit
_Concept_: When a learner achieves something, Senseis who helped get "producer credits" on that achievement. Like album liner notes.
_Novelty_: Public record of collaborative achievement. Deeply shareable.

**[SCAMPER #71]**: The Partner Tier
_Concept_: Beyond Follow — the learner co-creates with the mentor. Contributes to playlists, co-hosts jams, helps newer learners. Professional partnership.
_Novelty_: Most platforms cap the relationship at "repeat customer."

**[SCAMPER #72]**: The Sensei's Discovery Feed
_Concept_: Mentors start by following specific learners, then unlock Discover Mode for all learner struggles as they grow on the platform.
_Novelty_: Protects new mentors from overwhelm. Natural progression from known network to open discovery.

**[SCAMPER #73]**: The Sensei-to-Sensei Gradient
_Concept_: Same Discover → Follow → Partner gradient between mentors. Professional network among mentors with standalone value.
_Novelty_: Supply-side users form their own rich network.

### Theme 3: The Sensei Identity & Growth — Who Mentors Are and Why They Stay

**[Tutor Role #5]**: The Practitioner Network
_Concept_: Mentors are software engineers, data scientists, designers, accountants actively working in the field. Pitch: "Help someone the way you wish someone had helped you."
_Novelty_: Unlocks an entirely different talent pool than professional tutors.

**[Tutor Role #7]**: Low-Commitment Onboarding
_Concept_: Connect LinkedIn, pick topics, set hours — 2 minutes. Start with Flash Help to build ratings. The Uber model for mentors.
_Novelty_: Removes barriers that keep working professionals off existing platforms.

**[Retention #14]**: The Mentor Identity System
_Concept_: "Sensei," not "tutor." Impact narratives: "You helped Alex land their first data analyst role." Not transaction receipts.
_Novelty_: Frames relationship as experienced human → aspiring human.

**[Retention #15]**: The Mentorship Tree → **[SCAMPER #74]**: Mentorship Constellation
_Concept_: Visual galaxy of influence (evolved from tree metaphor). Every person helped is a star. Lines connect introductions. Clusters form around themes.
_Novelty_: Web of mutual growth, not top-down hierarchy. Visually stunning for sharing.

**[Retention #16]**: Practitioner Guilds
_Concept_: Purpose-themed communities — "Career Changers Guild," "First Job Guild," "Founder's Guild." Belonging around purpose, not subject.
_Novelty_: A UX designer and engineer in "Career Changers Guild" share more than two engineers in different guilds.

**[Retention #17]**: Peer Recognition, Not Platform Badges
_Concept_: Mentors endorse each other. Monthly "Mentor Spotlight" voted by peers, not algorithms.
_Novelty_: Peer recognition feels real. Platform badges feel corporate.

**[Growth #21]**: The Mentor Learns Too
_Concept_: Platform tracks what mentors learn through mentoring. AI insights on their explanation evolution and growth areas.
_Novelty_: Teaching is a two-way growth engine.

**[Growth #22]**: The Expertise Ladder
_Concept_: Flash Help → sessions → groups → micro-communities. Gated by demonstrated impact, not credentials.
_Novelty_: Visible growth path that mirrors a career ladder.

**[Growth #23]**: Reverse Mentoring
_Concept_: Senior mentors become learners from other mentors. Profile shows both sides — "Teaches: Backend. Learning: UX."
_Novelty_: Destroys rigid mentor/learner divide. Everyone is both.

**[Growth #24]**: Sensei Training — Meta-Mentorship
_Concept_: Experienced mentors coach newer mentors on facilitation skills. Earns "Master Sensei" status.
_Novelty_: Community teaches its own craft. Self-sustaining quality.

**[Growth #25]**: The Alumni Halo
_Concept_: Mentors who move on become "Founding Senseis." Permanent legacy. Can drop back anytime.
_Novelty_: Turns churn into marketing.

**[Growth #26]**: The Sensei Economy
_Concept_: Top mentors launch micro-communities. "Sarah's Backend Architecture Circle" — curated, own pricing. Shopify for mentorship.
_Novelty_: Platform becomes more valuable to top mentors over time. They build businesses, not just profiles.

**[Growth #27]**: The Mentorship Franchise
_Concept_: Master Senseis train and certify others in their methodology. Earn royalties from certified mentors' sessions.
_Novelty_: Transforms individuals into brands. Self-replicating quality system.

**[SCAMPER #75]**: The Sensei Portfolio
_Concept_: Unified professional identity page — impact stats, communities, playlists, producer credits, peer endorsements, contribution graph. Career asset beyond the platform.
_Novelty_: Professional value built through helping others. Paradoxically locks mentors in harder.

**[SCAMPER #76]**: The Flat Sensei Model
_Concept_: No platform-imposed hierarchy. Everyone is "Sensei." Reputation emerges from constellations, return rates, peer endorsements. Radical egalitarianism.
_Novelty_: Every act of mentorship has equal dignity. Alternative to gamified levels.

**[SCAMPER #77]**: Seasonal Identity Refresh
_Concept_: Quarterly reset of visible streak metrics (not constellation/legacy). Prevents entrenched incumbents from dominating. New mentors can compete.
_Novelty_: Solves early-mover marketplace dominance problem. Creates freshness.

### Theme 4: Social Learning & Quests — Learning as a Team Sport

**[Cross-Pol #48]**: Learning Parties
_Concept_: 3-5 learners with complementary skills tackling shared challenges, guided by a Sensei. Each person has a visible role.
_Novelty_: Transforms isolated learning into a team sport. Social commitment drives retention.

**[Cross-Pol #49]**: The Quest Board
_Concept_: Real challenges from companies, OSS projects, community. Learners form parties, mentors guide, output is real portfolio work.
_Novelty_: Learning by doing real things. Quests give wanderers destinations without forcing curricula.

**[Cross-Pol #50]**: Live Learning Sessions (Peloton Model)
_Concept_: A Sensei goes live — "I'm debugging a production issue, come watch." 50 learners join. Real-time Q&A. Gets recorded.
_Novelty_: Scales mentor time without losing live energy. FOMO drives engagement.

**[Cross-Pol #51]**: Sensei Recruiting for Quests
_Concept_: Mentors browse learners and recruit parties. "I need someone learning React, someone on WebSockets, someone trying DevOps." Mentor as raid leader.
_Novelty_: Combines mentor-initiated contact with gaming party structure.

**[Cross-Pol #52]**: The Public Quest
_Concept_: Learning parties tackle quests live with spectators. Twitch for learning.
_Novelty_: Turns learning into entertainment. Spectators become participants.

**[Cross-Pol #53]**: The Open Office Hours
_Concept_: Weekly drop-in sessions. No booking, no commitment. Regular attendees form community around a Sensei's time slot.
_Novelty_: Zero-friction recurring engagement. Creates ritual — the community heartbeat.

**[Cross-Pol #62]**: The Demo Session
_Concept_: Learners post rough, unfinished work. Senseis browse and offer feedback or say "I hear potential, let's develop this."
_Novelty_: Removes "I need a specific question" pressure. Mentors find learners through their work.

**[Cross-Pol #63]**: The Knowledge Jam
_Concept_: Open sessions around a broad theme. No agenda. Collective improvisation. Best ideas from unexpected collisions.
_Novelty_: Group chemistry IS the product.

**[Cross-Pol #64]**: The Collab Track
_Concept_: Two Senseis from different domains co-host. Disagreements and different perspectives ARE the lesson.
_Novelty_: Creative tension between approaches is more educational than either alone.

**[Cross-Pol #65]**: The Remix
_Concept_: Learners "remix" each other's completed projects — same starting point, different outcome. Chain of creative evolution.
_Novelty_: GitHub fork meets SoundCloud remix.

**[Growth #42]**: Study Buddy Invites
_Concept_: Learners on similar paths form small study groups. Each invites friends. Platform grows through learner-learner networks.
_Novelty_: Adds peer dimension. Every group member is an invite source.

**[SCAMPER #68]**: Quest-Triggered Flash Help
_Concept_: Flash Help requests tagged to active quest context. Mentor sees full picture. Answer helps whole party.
_Novelty_: Contextual support instead of isolated Q&A.

**[SCAMPER #78]**: The Reverse Quest
_Concept_: Learners design and post their own quests. Mentors apply. Learner picks their Sensei and recruits their party.
_Novelty_: Gives learners agency over learning design. Quest brief demonstrates growing competence.

**[SCAMPER #79]**: The Employer Quest
_Concept_: Companies post real challenges. Party tackles it with a Sensei. Company gets prototyping. Learners get portfolio + employer visibility. Hiring pipeline.
_Novelty_: Stealth recruiting platform. Companies pay for quest sponsorship — new revenue stream.

**[SCAMPER #80]**: The Capstone Quest
_Concept_: Final quest before graduation. Bigger, public, supervised by Master Sensei. Triggers graduation ceremony and learner-to-Sensei pipeline.
_Novelty_: Meaningful endpoint. Thesis defense + graduation + bridge to mentoring.

**[SCAMPER #81]**: The Hackathon Quest
_Concept_: Multiple parties tackle same quest simultaneously. Community votes. Friendly competition, all participants get portfolio work.
_Novelty_: Excitement without toxicity. Multiple valid solutions teach real-world ambiguity.

**[SCAMPER #82]**: The Peer-Only Quest
_Concept_: Advanced learners form parties without a Sensei. Can call for mentor "lifeline" mid-quest if stuck.
_Novelty_: Free tier with built-in conversion. Tests graduation readiness.

### Theme 5: Revenue & Economics — How Money Flows Honestly

**[Tutor Role #4]**: The Improvisation Premium
_Concept_: Adaptive mentoring (DJ/Sherpa style) is priced higher because it's genuinely harder and more valuable than lecturing.
_Novelty_: Justified premium for real-time human adaptation, not just "more expensive per hour."

**[Revenue #8]**: The Knowledge Passport
_Concept_: Monthly subscription ($29-49/mo) for unlimited micro-interactions. Deep-dive sessions cost extra credits.
_Novelty_: Shifts from transactional to relational. Wanderers stay subscribed.

**[Revenue #9]**: The Micro-Earnings Engine
_Concept_: $2-5 per Flash Help, $8-15 per check-in, $25-50 per deep-dive. Instant payouts.
_Novelty_: Instant micropayments create addictive help-giving loop.

**[Revenue #10]**: The Platform Margin Play
_Concept_: 30% on micro-transactions at massive volume. $1.50 per interaction x 50,000 daily = $75k/day.
_Novelty_: Higher percentage on tiny transactions nobody scrutinizes.

**[Revenue #11]**: Platform-Scored Quality
_Concept_: AI evaluates interaction quality. Practitioner earning multipliers set by outcome signals, not learner ratings.
_Novelty_: Removes gaming vector entirely.

**[Revenue #18]**: Infrastructure Fee, Not Mentorship Tax
_Concept_: Platform charges for video, AI notes, matching, payments, recording vault. Mentorship is free. Technology costs money.
_Novelty_: Same margin, completely different psychology.

**[Revenue #19]**: The Visible Receipt
_Concept_: Both sides see exactly where money went after every interaction. Full transparency.
_Novelty_: Radical transparency builds trust in community-first platform.

**[Revenue #20]**: Make Infrastructure So Good Mentors Can't Leave
_Concept_: AI pre-briefs, automatic follow-ups, session recordings, growth tracking. Tools no mentor could replicate with Zoom and Venmo.
_Novelty_: Prevents disintermediation by being genuinely irreplaceable.

**[Revenue #34]**: Revenue Grows With Relationship Depth
_Concept_: Discover ($3-5) → check-in ($15) → recurring ($40) → micro-community ($99/mo). Platform earns more as relationships deepen.
_Novelty_: Incentives fully aligned. Deeper connections = more revenue.

**[SCAMPER #66]**: AI-First, Human-Escalate
_Concept_: AI takes first pass on Flash Help — instant, free, 24/7. Resolves 60% of questions. Escalates the rest to a matched Sensei. Learner experiences the difference between AI knowledge and human wisdom.
_Novelty_: Solves unit economics. Makes human interaction feel premium. Free tier that converts.

### Theme 6: Trust Without Friction

**[Trust #12]**: Signal-Based Reputation
_Concept_: Replace explicit ratings with behavioral signals — repeat interactions, session extensions, referrals, outcome tracking.
_Novelty_: Eliminates review fatigue, removes gaming incentives.

**[Trust #13]**: The Return Rate as Currency
_Concept_: Most visible metric: return rate. "85% came back for more." Single number, ungameable, meaningful.
_Novelty_: Creates retention flywheel.

**Two-Tier Trust Model**: Professional reputation (LinkedIn-verified practitioners) + earned reputation (demonstrated impact). Different trust paths for different mentor types.

**[Cross-Pol #56]**: The Contribution Graph

_Novelty_: Lock people behind paywalls, not content. Correct value boundary.

### Theme 11: Accessibility, Emotional Intelligence & Scale

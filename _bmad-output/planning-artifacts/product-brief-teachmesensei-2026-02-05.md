# Product Brief: TeachMeSensei

## Executive Summary

TeachMeSensei is designed to make you not need it anymore.

It's a mentorship community — not a tutoring marketplace — where career switchers find working professionals who were in their shoes two years ago. Someone taps "I'm stuck" at 11pm, and within 60 seconds they're talking to a real human who felt the same way and made it through.

The platform exists because two problems feed each other. Career switchers into tech (27% of all career changers) are abandoned after bootcamp — no mentorship, no community, no one to navigate the gap between learning skills and surviving a real job. Meanwhile, thousands of working professionals remember what that felt like and want to help, but every platform makes mentoring feel transactional, burdensome, and thankless.

TeachMeSensei connects these two sides through a community that feeds itself. Learners arrive following their curiosity. They find a Sensei. The relationship deepens naturally. The learner lands their job, grows, graduates — and becomes a Sensei for the next person. The platform celebrates their departure. That's the product.

The collapse of information-based EdTech (Chegg: revenue -30%, workforce -67%) proves AI killed content. What AI cannot replace is human mentorship, career navigation, community belonging, and accountability. TeachMeSensei is built for the post-Chegg world.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

**The Learner Problem:** People switching careers into tech learn by following their curiosity, not a syllabus — but every platform forces them into rigid structure. After bootcamp, they're dropped into a void with no continued mentorship, no community, and no guidance for the messy reality of landing and surviving a first tech job. The result is isolation, imposter syndrome, and giving up.

**The Mentor Problem:** Thousands of working professionals want to give back. They remember what it was like to be lost and wish someone had helped them. But existing platforms turn mentoring into a transactional side hustle — client-vendor dynamics, star ratings to maintain, lesson prep they don't have time for. The identity of "mentor" gets stripped down to "service provider." They leave or never join.

These two problems are one problem: the people who need help and the people who want to help can't find each other in a way that feels human.

### Problem Impact

- 45% of career changers struggle with lack of relevant experience and workplace navigation after completing training
- Post-bootcamp graduates lack human guidance to bridge the gap between skills and employment — the highest-risk moment in their journey
- Imposter syndrome is the single biggest barrier to learning that no competitor addresses
- Existing mentorship platforms are either too expensive ($50-400/mo), too shallow (free but unvetted), or too transactional (pay-per-session, no relationship)
- Working professionals churn from mentoring platforms because the experience feels like unpaid labor, not purposeful community contribution

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Tutoring marketplaces** (MentorCruise, Wyzant, Codementor) are transactional — shop for a mentor, pay per session, no community or organic discovery
- **Free platforms** (ADPList) offer volume without depth — 25K mentors but low commitment and no quality signals
- **Bootcamps** (CoderSchool, MindX) end after graduation — the post-completion void is exactly where learners need the most support
- **Information-based EdTech** (Chegg) is dead — AI replaced homework help, proving content alone has no defensible value
- **No platform** treats both sides as humans with needs — learners are treated as customers, mentors as inventory

### Proposed Solution

TeachMeSensei is a mentorship community that:

1. **Meets learners where they are** — Three entry points based on emotional state ("I'm stuck" / "I'm curious" / "I'm preparing"), a curiosity feed for organic discovery, and intention prompts instead of search bars
2. **Honors mentors as practitioners** — Working professionals who guide from lived experience, matched on teaching style (DJ, Sherpa, Provocateur) and proximity of experience ("2 Years Ahead" matching). Identity, community, and visible legacy keep them — not money.
3. **Builds relationships naturally** — A gradient from Discover (curiosity feed, Flash Help) → Follow (deeper engagement) → Partner (co-creation), with commitment earned through trust, not sales pressure
4. **Uses AI to make humans more valuable** — Free AI layer resolves 60%+ of questions instantly; human mentorship handles career navigation, judgment, and emotional support at premium value
5. **Launches as a tool** — Enhances existing informal mentorship with scheduling, AI notes, and constellation visualization before building the marketplace layer

### Key Differentiators

1. **Designed to Graduate** — The platform celebrates your departure. "We're designed to make you not need us." Anti-engagement is the most powerful trust-building and engagement strategy. Graduated learners become the strongest referral source and the next generation of Senseis.
2. **Practitioner Mentor Network** — Working professionals, not career tutors. Unlocks a 10x larger supply pool motivated by identity, community, and giving back. They stay because mentoring makes them better at their own craft and builds a visible legacy.
3. **Signal-Based Trust** — Behavioral signals (return rates, session extensions, referrals) replace star ratings. Ungameable, meaningful reputation that protects both sides from gaming and review fatigue.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

#### The Wanderer (Learner)

**Maya, 29 — Marketing Coordinator → Junior Developer**

- **Background:** Bachelor's in Communications, 5 years in marketing. Completed a coding bootcamp 3 months ago. Currently job hunting while doing freelance marketing to pay bills.
- **Motivation:** Salary jump ($45K → $85K target), escape from "content hamster wheel," genuinely enjoys problem-solving
- **Current pain:** Graduated bootcamp with skills but no network. Applies to 50 jobs/week, gets ghosted. Imposter syndrome is crushing. No one to ask "is this normal?"
- **Emotional state:** Oscillates between "I'm stuck," "I'm curious," and "I'm preparing" — sometimes all three in one day
- **What success looks like:** Lands first dev job, has a Sensei she can text when her PR gets rejected, feels like she belongs in tech

#### The Sensei (Mentor)

**Marcus, 31 — Software Engineer (2.5 years experience)**

- **Background:** Career-switcher himself — was a high school math teacher, did a bootcamp, now mid-level engineer at a mid-size company
- **Motivation:** Remembers how lost he felt. Wants to help others avoid his mistakes. Also: mentoring makes him better at his own job (explaining forces clarity)
- **Current pain:** Tried ADPList — felt random and shallow. Tried informal mentoring — no tools, hard to track. Doesn't want to become a "tutor for hire" with star ratings and lesson prep
- **What success looks like:** Helps 3-4 people land jobs over a year. Sees his "constellation" grow. Gets recognized by peers in his Guild. Eventually, someone he mentored becomes a Sensei

### Secondary Users

#### The Lurker (Pre-Commitment)

**Jordan, 26 — Considering the switch**

- Still in their accounting job, coding nights/weekends
- Not ready to pay or commit — just watching, absorbing
- Browses curiosity feed, watches Sensei clips, reads graduation stories

**Conversion Triggers:**
1. **Friendly open community** — Real conversations, not polished marketing. Hot Takes with comments. Senseis disagreeing respectfully. Feels alive, not corporate.
2. **Easy access** — No signup wall. Curiosity feed is public. Three clicks from watching a Sensei explain something they struggled with yesterday.
3. **Sensei-initiated** (highest intent) — Jordan posts a question on Reddit. A Sensei DMs: "Hey, I saw your question — I was stuck on the same thing 2 years ago. Happy to chat." That's not a platform — that's a person choosing *them*.

#### The Graduated Sensei (The Flywheel)

**Maya 2.0, 30 — Junior Developer → First-Time Sensei**

- 8 months into her first dev job
- Still remembers the fear, the rejections, the moment Marcus made her exhale
- Gets a prompt: "Someone just asked the same question you asked Marcus 10 months ago. Want to help?"
- Hesitates — "Am I qualified?" — then remembers Marcus was only 2 years ahead
- Her first Flash Help takes 12 minutes. She tears up a little after.
- Her constellation has one star now. She wants more.

#### The Bootcamp Partner (B2B)

**CoderSchool / CodeGym (Vietnam bootcamps)**

- Needs post-graduation support layer to improve placement stats
- Would embed TeachMeSensei as "what happens after you graduate"
- Pays per cohort for 3-month Knowledge Passport access
- *Persona TBD — validate through early partner conversations*

### User Journey

**Maya's Journey from Lost to Sensei:**

| Stage | Experience | TeachMeSensei Moment |
|---|---|---|
| **Discovery** | Sees a graduation story on LinkedIn from someone who switched from marketing | Clicks through, lands on curiosity feed |
| **Lurk** | Browses for 2 weeks — watches clips, reads Hot Takes | No signup required |
| **First interaction** | Taps "I'm stuck" after a brutal rejection | AI resolves her technical question, but she needs human help with "am I good enough?" |
| **Flash Help** | Matched with Marcus for a 15-min session | $5. He tells her his story. She exhales. |
| **Follow** | Taps "Follow this Sensei" | Deeper engagement begins |
| **Recurring** | Weekly check-ins with Marcus | $40/mo. He reviews her PRs, preps her for interviews |
| **Success** | Lands job at a startup | Graduation celebration, producer credits for Marcus |
| **Graduate** | 6 months later, becomes a Sensei herself | The cycle continues |

## Success Metrics

### North Star Metric: Graduation Rate

**The metric that matters most:** Percentage of learners who successfully transition to their first tech job and no longer need the platform.

- **Target:** Land first tech job within 6 months of first Flash Help
- **Graduation moment:** Job offer accepted + 90-day mark survived
- **Flywheel indicator:** % of graduates who become Senseis within 12 months

*"We're designed to make you not need us."* — Graduation rate is the public-facing proof that TeachMeSensei works.

### Metrics Tiering

## MVP Scope

### Launch Philosophy

**"Launch as a tool, not a marketplace."**

Phase 1 seeds the supply side by enhancing existing informal mentorship. Phase 2 opens the marketplace layer once we have active, proven Senseis.

### Phase 1: Mentor Tool (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** 10 active Sensei-learner pairs using the tool weekly

For people already mentoring informally — give them infrastructure they can't replicate with Zoom and Venmo.

**Core Features:**
- Session scheduling (Google Calendar integration)
- Video chat via integration (Daily.co or similar) with recording
- AI transcription + automatic session notes (Whisper + GPT)
- Invite codes (5 per Sensei to bring their existing learners)

**Deferred to Phase 2:**
- Constellation visualization
- Sensei style tags (DJ, Sherpa, Provocateur)

**Success Gate for Phase 2:**
- 10 active pairs using tool weekly for 30 days
- >50% of learners book a second session within 14 days
- Senseis report "I can't go back to Zoom"

### Phase 2: Flash Help (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** 50+ Flash Help sessions, prove unit economics

Open the marketplace layer with the "I'm stuck" moment.

**Core Features:**
- Three entry points: "I'm stuck" / "I'm curious" / "I'm preparing"
- AI-first layer (resolves 60%+ instantly, free)
- Human escalation with Sensei matching ("2 Years Ahead" + style match)
- $5 micro-transaction for human Flash Help
- Sensei style tags (DJ, Sherpa, Provocateur) — now needed for matching
- Constellation visualization — reward for mentoring
- Return rate tracking (signal-based trust, no star ratings)

**Success Gate for v2:**
- 50+ Flash Help sessions completed
- >60% AI resolution rate
- >40% of human escalations lead to repeat booking
- At least 1 learner lands a job (first graduation)

### Out of Scope for MVP

| Feature | Why Deferred | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Curiosity feed / content discovery | Marketplace must work first | v2 |
| Learning Parties / Quests / Jams | Social layer after core loop | v2 |
| Guilds and community features | Community after relationships | v2 |
| Follow → Partner gradient | Start with Flash Help only | v2 |
| Knowledge Passport subscription | Prove micro-transactions first | v2 |
| Employer Quests / B2B | After product-market fit | v3 |
| Mobile app | Web-first, mobile later | v2-v3 |
| Bootcamp integrations | After proven graduation rate | v3 |

### MVP Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Gate (Week 4):**
- 10 active Sensei-learner pairs
- >50% of learners book second session within 14 days
- Qualitative signal: "I can't go back to Zoom"

**Phase 2 Gate (Week 8-12):**
- 50+ Flash Help sessions
- >60% AI resolution rate
- >40% repeat booking rate
- First graduation (job landed)

**Go/No-Go for v2:**
If gates met → proceed to curiosity feed, Follow mode, subscriptions
If gates missed → iterate on core loop before expanding

### Future Vision

**v2 (Months 3-6): The Relationship Layer**
- Follow mode (deeper engagement beyond Flash Help)
- Curiosity feed (content as discovery)
- Knowledge Passport subscription ($29-49/mo)
- Graduation ceremony and producer credits
- Learner-to-Sensei pipeline prompt

**v3 (Months 6-12): The Community Layer**
- Guilds (purpose-based communities)
- Learning Parties and Quests
- Employer Quests (hiring pipeline)
- Bootcamp partnerships (B2B)

**Long-term (Year 2+): The Platform**
- Sensei Economy (micro-communities, own pricing)
- TeachMeSensei API (mentorship as infrastructure)
- Pay-It-Forward Fund (community-funded accessibility)
